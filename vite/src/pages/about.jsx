          <p>
            We made a Web3 Journey and roadmaps in order to have a platform
            where people can learn about web3 for free and become a player in
            building healthy web3 economy & your career future. We will support
            the new tech and learner’s initiatives by building online library,
            working on hackathon with you, and offering productive co-working opportunities and community.

            Yaruhito means “Doer” in Japanese. Not only programming or Web3, or any new technology, learning path is lonely and can be mandane. I think motivation is highly overated, and I myself needed a platform that gets you do things.
